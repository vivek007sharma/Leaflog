## Introduction:
  LeafLog is an AI-powered web application that classifies plant leaves and provides detailed blogs about them. Built with React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend), it uses a Keras deep learning model to identify leaves from images. Users can upload a leaf image, receive its classification, and learn about its medicinal or botanical significance through an informative blog. 🚀🌿

## ✨ Features  

✅ Upload an image of a leaf for identification.  
✅ AI-powered classification using a trained deep learning model.  
✅ Displays the predicted leaf class.
✅ Fetches a related blog about the identified plant.  
✅ Seamless frontend-backend communication using FastAPI and React.
